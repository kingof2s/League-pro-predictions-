# Framing the problem
For our problem, we wanted to look at data to try and predict which team would win the game by 15 minutes. This is a binary classification, where a value of 1 is a team winning and a value of 0 is a team losing. We made sure to only include information which is only available during the first 15 minutes, so we didn't include factors like barons and elder dragon which come into play after 15 minutes. We also didn't look at total gold or experience, only gold/xp at 15 minutes, since that is the only data available within our time frame.
