# Framing the problem
For our problem, we wanted to look at data to try and predict which team would win the game by 15 minutes. This is a binary classification, where a value of 1 is a team winning and a value of 0 is a team losing. We made sure to only include information which is only available during the first 15 minutes. We looked at gold, xp, kills, deaths, and assists at 15 minutes, since obviously we know these values at the time of prediction. We also looked at certain objectives which come into play before 15 minutes, such as first dragon, first herald, and turret plates. Dragon and rift herald come spawn at 5 and 8 minutes in, and typically taken close to the time they spawn. While there is a chance the first dragon and first rift herald are taken after 15 minutes, we believe there are only a very small and statistically insignificant number of games where this happens, so we decided to include them in our data. We avoided looking at objectives like baron and elder dragon however, since those do not come into play by until after 15 minutes.
